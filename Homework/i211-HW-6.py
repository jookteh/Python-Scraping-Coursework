# (20 pts) Create a table called Addresses that has the fields AddressID, Name, Address1, Address2, City, State, Zip
# (40 pts) Ask the user to enter a Name, Address line one, Address line two (optional), City, State and Zip. Add their responses as an entry in your Addresses table.
# (10 pts) Ask the user if they would like to input a new address. Repeat step two until they say they donâ€™t want to enter a new address.
# (30 pts) Once they are done entering ask the user for the name of the person they would like to look up. Show them the address(s) for everyone with that name.
