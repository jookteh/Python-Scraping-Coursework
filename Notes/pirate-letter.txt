Avast   ye     landlubbers!



If yer reading    this  here letter,        let it be known   that I,
the        dread pirate Black Beard,        shall never be found.






Aye, even with   your mighty modern mumbo-jumbo,    you scallywags


will never         find out my last location, where      I've hidden all of
me                gold dubloons!



See   you in  Davy Jones' Locker,





Black Beard
